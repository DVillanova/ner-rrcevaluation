# HOSTING COMPETITION ON RRC

To hold a competition on the RRC site you have to:
- Implement a REST service with docker implementing 2 methods (validation and evaluation)
- Provide the Ground Truth
- Provide a task configuration file
- If you want to show samples information:
    - Provide samples Zip
    - Enter details on the configuration file


## Submition validation
This method must validate the submition file/s and verify that all files have the correct format (all required fields are present and have to correct type) and the sample IDs matches the Ground Truth ones.

### Format
    [POST] /validate
    INPUTS:

    | Parameter | Type | Description |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | gt | String/required | Internal path of the Ground Truth. If not specified the Ground Truth has to be inside the docker. (/var/www/gt/test.json in the example) |
    | results | String | Internal path with the results file. (* Required if resultsFile param is not specified.) RRC will call it with a value starting with /var/www/submits (the docker mounted folder) |
    | resultsFile | File | File with the results |
    | methodParams | String/optional | Method params in JSON |


    OUTPUT:
    A JSON string with the following Dict:

    | Key | Type | Description |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | result | Boolean | The results file is valid or not. |
    | msg | String | If the results file is not valid, should return information here. |




## Results calculation
This method evaluates the submition and calculates the results. If you want to show per sample information, the method has to generate a ZIP file with the file ‘method.json’ containing the method metrics results and also add individual sample information, adding the file {Sample ID}.json for each sample. Also, if your visualization requires extra information, you can add more files to the ZIP file so you can use it in your visualization.


### Format
    [POST] /evaluate
    INPUTS:
    | Parameter | Type | Description |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | gt | String/required | Internal path of the Ground Truth. If not specified the Ground Truth has to be inside the docker. (/var/www/gt/test.json in the example) |
    | results | String | Internal path with the results file. (* Required if resultsFile param is not specified.) RRC will call it with a value starting with /var/www/submits (the docker mounted folder) |
    | resultsFile | File | File with the results |
    | methodParams | String/optional | Method params in JSON |

    OUTPUT:
    A JSON string with the following Dict:
    | Key | Type | Description |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | result | Boolean | The evaluation has been completed succesfully. |
    | msg | String | Information about the error on the evaluation. |
    | method | dict | Results for the whole method. Metric and score. |
    | samplesUrl | String * | URL to download the results ZIP file with samples information. *Required if you want to show samples information. |


## Configuration
This method has to return information about the task and the metrics expected for the evaluation.

### Format
    [GET] /config

    OUTPUT:
    A JSON string with the following Dict:
    | Key | Type | Description |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | title | String | The task title |
    | msg | String | Information about the error on the evaluation. |
    | method | dict | Results for the whole method. Metric and score. |
    | samplesUrl | String * | URL to download the results ZIP file with samples information. *Required if you want to show samples information. |



As working with docker, you can opt for your preferred programming language. The calculations but must be implemented on the same machine, you can’t call any external service for that purpose.

If you work with Python, you can start with the sample Docker and you will only have to implement the calcuation script 'script.py' adding the dependencies on the requirements.txt file.

Metrics and results.
You can include multiple metrics on the results file. On the competition results page you can show one or more of that metrics but only one will be the primary for the ranking.
The same applies for the samples, you can use different metrics but.


REST SERVICE

<ul>
    <li><strong>/script/script.json</strong> Your validation & Evaluation script</li>
    <li><strong>/requirements.txt</strong> Include your script dependencies</li>
    <li><strong>/gt/config.json</strong> The file with the task configuration</li>
    <li><strong>/gt/test.json</strong> Your ground Truth File</li>
