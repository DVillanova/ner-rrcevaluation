# Visualization
A visualization for the samples results. (default,TL_iou,Segm,E2E,E2E_video) Each visualization requires diferent metrics or properties on the results file generated by the evaluation.

## Default Visualization (default)
This visualization shows the image(/s) for the current sample and lists all the properties present on the JSON file of the sample results.

## Text Line Intersection Over Union (TL_iou)
This visualization shows:
    2 blocks of the current image sample, the first one with the Ground Truth Polygons and the other with the detection ones.
    Intersection Over Union Matrix, with intersection results between all GT vs. Det pairs.
    Evaluation log

For this visualization, you have to include on JSON file of the sample results the variables:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| gtPolPoints | array | GT bounding boxes. Each Bounding box has an array of point \[x1,y1,x2,y2, .. , xn,yn\] |
| detPolPoints | array | Det bounding boxes. Each Bounding box has an array of point [x1,y1,x2,y2, .. , xn,yn]
| gtDontCare  | array | Indexes of the GT bounding boxes defined as Don't care
| iouMatrix |  array |  Intersection values between GT an Detection BBs. \[GT\]/\[DET\] = Intersection value
| evaluationLog  | String | Log of important parts of the evaluation process
